Hello! This is a short description of my project ideas for my final project.

1. PLANS ON WHAT TO SIMULATE
I'm very late on getting my project together, but I have two ideas. One idea I've started collecting data on, and the other I still have yet to start due to its potential to be too complicated for the time I have left. The first idea, which may be too simple on the other hand, was to simply take several different cans of opened carbonated drinks and periodically weigh them and see if I could model the way that they dissipate the gases and go flat. The hope was that the weight change would be measureable enough to chart the process. The other idea was to record myself climbing and model the path my center of mass takes and see how this affects my climbing ability. This would potentially involve using some third party applications like OpenPose to track limbs and joints, and could be a little more involved.

2. PHYSICS INVOLVED
Carbonation Dissipation: Ideal Gas Law, Newton's Law of Cooling-like behavior, Fick's Law of diffusion, general thermodynamics principles
Climbing COM: Newtonian Mechanics (Center of Mass, torque, potential energy, energy conservation, etc)

3. TOOLS TO USE
Python, NumPy, OpenCV, matplotlib, pandas, scipy.optimize (possibly OpenPose or MediaPipe, or something called "Tracker" for video analysis)
